**1.** This is a stereonet, a tool used in structural geology for plotting features orientated in 3D space, such as lines and planes, into a 2D graph.

Specifically, a stereonet is a stereographic projection of the lower hemisphere. What does this mean? You are here to answer this question to yourself by exploring the representation of a plane under this projection.

The curved line you see here, comprised of the red, yellow and blue points, represents a single and unique orientation of a plane in 3D space. This orientation can be defined by several notations, some of which are shown in the "Readings" panel. Another graphical representation of these readings is displayed in the "Compass/Clinometer" panel, since they often come from in-situ measurements using these intruments. Finally, the actual plane orientation being represented is shown in the "3D View" section along with some helpful indicators.

To change the plane orientation you can click on any point on the stereonet, or drag any of the colored points to the desired position.
