**4.** Finally, here is where everything comes together. This section presents a 3D view of the current plane's orientation together with the lower hemisphere of the *horizontal coordinate system*.

The needles from the "Compass/Clinometer" section together with the points from the stereonet section are also shown for reference purposes.

Try changing the camera position to get a top down view of the plane, and notice the relation of the intersection line between the plane and the lower hemisphere with the plane's plot in the stereonet.
