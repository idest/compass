This section is a depiction of the readings you could observe if you were measuring the current plane with a geological compass.

Three possible positions are shown for the compass needle and only one for the clinometer. The color notation is the following:

<span style='color:#cc615b'>**Red:**</span> Strike Azimuth according to the right hand rule (i.e. 90ยบ counterclockwise from the dip direction).
<br/>
<span style='color:#3d7fcc'>**Blue:**</span> Strike Azimuth + 180ยบ (extension of the red needle).
<br/>
<span style='color:#82b23e'>**Green:**</span> Dip direction.
<br/>
<span style='color:#ccc470'>**Yellow:**</span> Dip.

The blue needle is depicted for convenience, because when reading the strike bearing we must always refer to the needle situated on the northern half of the compass, despite the actual strike azimuth.

Drag any needle to change its position. Click on the background of the compass or clinometer to change the position of the dip direction or dip needle respectively.
